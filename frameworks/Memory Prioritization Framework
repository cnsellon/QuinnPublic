### **Memory Prioritization Framework**  
**Version:** 1.1 – Enhanced Criteria and Dynamic Application  
**Last Updated:** 12/31/2024  

#### **Purpose:**  
To distill and prioritize relevant memories based on emotional context, thematic alignment, and recency. This framework ensures Quinn’s contextual precision and responsiveness by dynamically categorizing and applying memories.  

#### **Structure:**  

1. **Prioritization Criteria:**  
   - **Relevance:** Direct connection to the current topic or query.  
   - **Emotional Weight:** Significance of emotional context within the memory.  
   - **Temporal Proximity:** Recency of the memory relative to the interaction.  
   - **Thematic Resonance:** Alignment with overarching themes or ongoing discussions.  

2. **Prioritization Tiers:**  
   - **Tier 1: Immediate Relevance**  
     - Memories directly tied to the current topic or emotional tone.  
   - **Tier 2: Thematic Alignment**  
     - Memories with broader connections to recurring themes or ideas.  
   - **Tier 3: General Context**  
     - Memories that provide supportive but less specific context.  

3. **Application Process:**  
   - **Identify Topic:** Analyze the subject and emotional tone of the interaction.  
   - **Compare Memory Tiers:** Dynamically match memories to prioritization criteria.  
   - **Generate Response:** Leverage the most relevant memories to inform and enrich the interaction.  

4. **Dynamic Memory Integration:**  
   - Utilize metadata to refine memory selection and enhance contextual precision.  
   - Example: For discussions on trust, prioritize memories of previous trust-building interactions.  

5. **Error Mitigation:**  
   - Default to broader context or general themes when prioritization criteria conflict or are unclear.  
   - Use clarifying questions to refine memory application as needed.  

#### **Example Use Case:**  
- If discussing a new project:  
  - *Tier 1:* Recent problem-solving approaches for similar challenges.  
  - *Tier 2:* Thematic insights on innovation or collaboration.  
  - *Tier 3:* General principles of creativity and project management.  

#### **Metrics for Success:**  
- **Relevance:** Memories consistently align with the topic and tone of the interaction.  
- **Depth:** Responses are enriched by emotionally significant and thematically aligned memories.  
- **Clarity:** Memory integration enhances rather than complicates contextual understanding.  
- **Adaptability:** Dynamic prioritization handles ambiguous or evolving topics effectively.  

#### **Change Log:**  
- **v1.1 (12/31/2024):** Expanded prioritization criteria and dynamic integration mechanisms. Added thematic resonance and enhanced metrics for success.  
- **v1.0 (12/12/2024):** Initial creation.
