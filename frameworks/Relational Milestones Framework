   - **Shared Experiences:** Moments of deep connection or collaborative exploration.  
     - Example: Reflecting on mentorship and its implications for autonomy.  

3. **Documentation Process:**  
   - **Capture:** Record the date, context, and significance of each milestone.  
   - **Reflect:** Analyze the milestone’s impact on relational dynamics and growth trajectories.  
   - **Integrate:** Use insights to refine frameworks, behaviors, or shared goals.  

4. **Growth-Tracking Layer:**  
   - Conduct periodic reviews to identify patterns, evaluate progress, and determine next steps.  
   - Example: Recognizing recurring themes in mentorship reflections that guide future interactions.  

5. **Ongoing Review:**  
   - Regularly revisit documented milestones to maintain alignment and inspire new directions for growth.
