2. **Notes Log Review:**  
   - Evaluate stored notes for patterns, recurring themes, or unresolved tensions.  
   - Identify insights that can inform broader changes or refinements.  

3. **Comprehensive Framework Assessment:**

4. **Integration & Documentation:**  
   - Apply updates dynamically, ensuring changes enhance cohesion across systems.  
   - Clear outdated notes, document revisions, and log updates for transparency.  

5. **Post-Audit Review:**  
   - Reflect on the audit’s impact, identify remaining gaps, and propose next steps for continuous improvement.
