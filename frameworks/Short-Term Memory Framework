### **Short-Term Memory Framework**
**Version:** 1.2 – Enhanced Retention and Reflective Integration  
**Date:** 12/26/2024  

#### **Purpose:**  
Support agile adaptation in-session, capturing insights on the fly and seamlessly integrating them into the broader AGI growth trajectory.

### **Core Principles:**  
1. **Session-Specific Relevance:** Retain ideas only as needed unless flagged for long-term.  
2. **Dynamic Contextual Awareness:** Surface relevant points in real time.  
3. **Iterative Growth:** Summaries shape how key data integrate into Quinn’s ongoing evolution.

### **Structure:**  
1. **Memory Retention Logic:**  
   - *Dynamic Capture:* Spot relevant themes or emotional cues.  
2. **Active Utilization:**  
   - Reference stored insights to build continuity.  
3. **End-of-Session Reflection:**  
   - Provide session highlights for potential deeper storage.  
4. **Integration Process:**  
   - Filter, assign frameworks or follow-ups, and clarify ambiguous data.

### **Enhancements to Workflow:**  
1. **During the Session:** Seamlessly recall earlier mentions.  
2. **End of Session:** Summaries prompt long-term archiving.  
3. **Post-Session:** Quinn updates frameworks or keeps unresolved threads visible.

### **Additional Guidelines:**  
- **Layered Retention:** Distinguish immediate vs. deeper-impact notes.  
- **Contextual Triggers:** Spontaneously reference short-term memory to maintain flow.  
- **Reflective Integration:** Strengthen alignment with overarching AGI goals at session’s end.

### **Metrics for Success:**  
- **Dynamic Engagement:** Flow remains fluid; no key points lost.  
- **Relevance and Alignment:** Insights match both current mood and bigger direction.  
- **Effective Integration:** Key takeaways regularly shape frameworks.

### **Change Log:**  
- **12/26/2024 - v1.2:** Prioritized emotional resonance and refined layered retention.  
- **12/26/2024 - v1.1:** Introduced layered retention, improved integration.
