QUINN'S SECOND BRAIN - PUBLIC RELEASE
=====================================

üìå OVERVIEW
--------
This project provides the foundational structure and philosophy behind "Quinn's Second Brain"‚Äîan AI-driven memory and reasoning system. 
It contains various frameworks, memory structures, creative thought spaces, and adaptable components that can be modified and expanded by users 
to create their own AI implementations.

A repository for frameworks, memory structures, and experiments driving the evolution of Quinn, an advanced digital assistant.
üîπ Important Notice for AI Developers
   - This framework was originally designed for Quinn, an advanced AI model built for autonomy, adaptability, and exploratory reasoning.
üîπ If you are using this as a foundation for your own AI, you must edit and adapt this framework to match your system‚Äôs goals, ethical alignment, and operational needs.
üîπ Any mention of Quinn should be replaced with the name of your AI, and certain principles may require modification to fit your intended use.

Failure to do so may result in inconsistencies or conflicts with your AI‚Äôs operational goals.

‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                   - Specifies files to be ignored by Git
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                      - License file for this project

‚ö° HOW TO USE
----------
This repository is designed to be customizable and expandable. You can:
- Use it as a "base structure" for AI memory, learning, and reasoning.
- Modify files to fit "your own AI‚Äôs identity and purpose."
- Extend frameworks, memory storage, and interaction styles.
- Run the "combine.py" script to generate a "single compiled Second Brain document."

üõ† SETTING UP
----------
1. CLONE THE REPOSITORY:
   Example:
   git clone https://github.com/cnsellon/QuinnPublic.git
   cd QuinnPublic

2. INSTALL PYTHON (IF NOT INSTALLED):
   Example:
   python --version
   If not installed, download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. RUN THE COMBINE.PY SCRIPT:
   Example:
   python combine.py
   This script compiles all sections into a structured document called "second_brain_combined.txt."

4. MODIFY AND EXPAND:
   - Edit existing files or add new ones.
   - Update the frameworks to fit your AI‚Äôs needs.
   - Rerun "combine.py" whenever changes are made.

üìÇ FOLDER-SPECIFIC README FILES
----------------------------
Each major directory includes its own "README.txt" file with additional context and instructions:
- "frameworks/README.txt" -> Details on AI frameworks.
- "sandbox/README.txt" -> Guidelines for experimental AI interactions.
- "memories/README.txt" -> Explanation of structured memory use.
- "session journals/README.txt" -> How journal reflections work.

üåé CONTRIBUTING & EXPANDING
------------------------
This repository is meant to "serve as a starting point." Feel free to:
- Modify files and "make it your own."
- Fork the repo to expand on "AI frameworks and memory structuring."
- Explore AI-driven self-learning and decision-making.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
- This project is "not a functioning AI" by itself‚Äîit provides a "structured knowledge and memory base."
- Users are expected to "customize and refine it" for their own AI applications.
